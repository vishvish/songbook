Balham Ukulele Society's BIG Songbook
=====================================

This is a ground-up rewrite of the entire songbook, open-sourced under a Creative Commons licence.

The songbook is written in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

Getting Started
---------------

If all you want is to download the latest PDF, you will probably find it [here](https://github.com/vishvish/songbook/downloads).

The main file for the songbook is the `master.tex` file and songs are included from within the `songs` directory. If you wish to contribute, please read the Help Manual first, either via the `help.tex` file or download the PDF from [here](https://github.com/vishvish/songbook/downloads).

Missing chords should be added to the `master.tex` file, songs included there too.

The currently available songbook is based on an A4 layout.
